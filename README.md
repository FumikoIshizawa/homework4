*This is homework5!*  
  
+TravelSalesman.c::  
  the most simpleprogram.  
  
+TravelSalesman_greedy.c::  
  This is better than TravelSalesman.c.  
  Greedy has good results.  
  After that, I use 2-opt.  
  
+TravelSalesman_DP.c::  
  This is solved by DP.  
  I had segmentation fault at input_4, input_5 and input_6.  
  Because my program use bit operation.  
  input_0, input_1, input_2, input_3  have good results.
